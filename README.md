## Custom Chatbot
- This is one implementation of a GPT powered chatbot on a custom/private information base.  This specific example uses 20+ pages of company case studies to act as a Q&A chatbot helping others learn about a company and get to ask questions about the kind of work the company has done.  This is possible to do with all sorts of custom data specific to a company to make for a custom chatbot allowing customers to ask questions without having to try to find the information themselves.
